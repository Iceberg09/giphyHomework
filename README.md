# giphyHomework

This project is used to show 2 different types of buttons:

1) Preset buttons (listed under the initial topics variable).
2) Buttons that can be added using the "add a new snack" button. This will then add the button to the existing row of buttons and also add that snack to the topics variable.

Once the button is pressed, it will load 10 gifs. Each gif will initially show a still image. Once clicked, they will switch to their animated state. If clicked again, they will switch back to their still state.
